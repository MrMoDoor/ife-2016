            <p>某南方高校的几个青年，欲认识前端，学习前端。</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square
                    holes.</p>
                <p>The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the
                    status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.</p>
                <p>About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They invent. They
                    imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward.</p>
                <p>Maybe they have to be crazy.</p>
                <p>How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song
                    that’s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?</p>
                <p>We make tools for these kinds of people.</p>
                <p>While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to
                    think they can change the world, are the ones who do.</p></blockquote>
